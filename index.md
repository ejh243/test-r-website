## Overview

Reproducibility and code sharing has become a hot topic in research. Many researchers are reluctant to share their code as they view it as “ugly”, or “messy”. They are also conscious that they might not be executing the task in the “correct” way. This course is aimed at those with some experience of R who have a script they want to improve the style, performance and/or reproducibility of. Our objective is provide you with tools and tips that make you feeling more confident in your ability as a programmer and ultimately empower you to feel confident sharing that code.

## Course objectives

This course will covering the following:

- what makes code easy to follow or use
- what are good coding practices that emphasise readability and functionality
- how to define a personal coding style
- how to develop the structure and content of an R script to improve its functionality or reproducibility
- how to measure the quality/efficiency of an R script


## Pre-requisites

- Students will need to bring their own laptops and have access to a text editor and R or Rstudio.
- A current user of R
- An existing R script that they want to develop during the course of the workshop.
