In this course you will receive a guided tour of RStudio. From installing the required software to running the basic commands in a script. We will help you installating R and RStudio and equip you with the basic notions of RStudio to ease your progress. These notions include an understaning of the RStudio layout, how to create a script, and run basic commands. There are some exercises for you to check your understanding and in case you want more, there is a script in section 10 with more commands and other examples.


# What are R and RStudio?

**R** and **RStudio** are both free software programs used for statistical analysis. R is the program performing the commands and RStudio provides an interface so that users have an improved experience using the program. 


The RStudio interface is designed so that you can see the plots, tables and code at the same time. You will learn about the layout of RStudio in this course. For now, you just need to know that R and RStudio work together and that RStudio is a friendlier version for the user.

R and RStudio have many advantages, for instance:

  - They are free and open source. This means that there is a huge community readily available to help you solve questions or issues with your code. It also means that there's people developing new hacks to make possible more advanced operations.
  - They are available for Windows, Macintosh, and Linux.
  - RStudio is not only used for analysis, you can also create documents and slides, and you can embed your analysis into these documents. It's like having Word, Excel and Powerpoint in one place.

# Installation

Because R and RStudio work together, you need to install them both. The steps in this section should guide you through the process. Once installed, you will be working with RStudio and R will be running in the back. 

*Note* that when people say R, most of the time, they are referring to RStudio.
