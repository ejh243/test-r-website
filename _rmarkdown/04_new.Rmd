**Assign a name to your command.**

This action will become very useful. You assign names to objects so that then you can perform operations with these objects, such as plotting.

```{r echo=TRUE}
## 1.2 Create an object using the assign symbol (<-)
a <- 2+2 # Run this command and look at pane 3
```

<br>

**Plot your variable 'a'.** 
```{r  fig.align='center', echo=TRUE}
## 1.3 Let's plot our object
plot(a) # This appears on pane 4
```

<br>

## Using built-in data

R has readily available data sets for you to explore, play, analyse, plot... 

Run this command if you want a list of what's available:

```{r echo=TRUE}
data()
```

There are a few that are commonly used in R-Training sessions. You will encounter these frequently:

- mtcars
- USArrests
- iris

<br>

**Iris data set**

This data set holds information about 50 flowers of 3 species of iris. 
```{r,  fig.align='left', echo = FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/iris.png"))
```

<br>
If you want to know more about this data set. 

```{r echo=TRUE}
?iris # Look at pane 4
```
