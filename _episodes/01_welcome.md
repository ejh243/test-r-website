## Welcome

Welcome to **R: from beginner to intermediate**. Our aim is to provide you with a comprehensive overview of the R programming language assuming no prior knowledge of R or programming. While the commands may be specific to R, some of the concepts are applicable to more programming languages so what oyu learn over the course of these four sessions will provide you will skills that are transferable to other languages. 

Introduction of workshop leader and helpers.

We ask you to mark your attendance so we are able to report at the end of academic year how many staff & students we have delivered to. 

## Introduction to Coding For Reproducible Research

Our ambition is to offer a recurring annual series of workshops open to all staff and students, with opportunities for novices through to more experienced users, to expand their skill sets and position them to confidently perform the informatics research projects in an efficient and reproducible way. A key objective is that the framework we put in place ensures that the workshops delivered are fit for purpose, of a consistent high standard, that delivery is sustainable in the longer term, minimises the workload burden on those who facilitate them and can adapt and expand as new training needs are identified.

Championed by and in partnership with

- Research Software Engineering group
- Institute of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (IDSAI)
- Researcher Development (Doctoral College and ECRs)
- Reproducibility Network Institutional Leadership team
- Quantitative Health Network (QHN) 
- EPSRC Hub for Quantitative Modelling in Healthcare
- Translational Research Exchange @ Exeter (TREE)


This workshop, and the others in the series, were put together by a series of working groups formed by researchers from across the University supported by Exeter's Research Software Engineering Group. The programme and workshops are under constant evolution. We appreciate your patience as we develop and test these materials and are grateful for your feedback which is a core component of this process. 


## Housekeeping

The workshop in organised into episodes of content, which can be seen in the workshop schedule available on the course website. Our aim is to have an official break every 60-90 minutes. Our aim is to be responsive to the needs of the group, both in person and virtual. Therefore, think of the schedule as a guide rather than a strict timetable. This workshop will be delivered by live coding. We welcome questions and queries as we go along, so raise your hand if you need assistance. We would like to highlight that we have a [code of conduct](https://uniexeterrse.github.io/intro-to-r/code.html) and by attending this workshop you are agreeing to abide by it. 

Let's get started.
