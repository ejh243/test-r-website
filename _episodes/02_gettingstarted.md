# What are R and RStudio?

**R** and **RStudio** are both free software programs used for statistical analysis. R is the program performing the commands and RStudio provides an interface so that users have an improved experience using the program. 


The RStudio interface is designed so that you can see the plots, tables and code at the same time. You will learn about the layout of RStudio in this course. For now, you just need to know that R and RStudio work together and that RStudio is a friendlier version for the user.

R and RStudio have many advantages, for instance:

  - They are free and open source. This means that there is a huge community readily available to help you solve questions or issues with your code. It also means that there's people developing new hacks to make possible more advanced operations.
  - They are available for Windows, Macintosh, and Linux.
  - RStudio is not only used for analysis, you can also create documents and slides, and you can embed your analysis into these documents. It's like having Word, Excel and Powerpoint in one place.
